## Task 6 : Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.

### Objective: 

Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

### Tools: 

Online free password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).

### Deliverables:  

Report showing password strength results and explanation

### Solution:

Created multiple passwords with varying complexity (simple, mixed case, with numbers, with symbols, and based on a phrase).

[Tested Password list](Passwordlist.txt)

Tested each password using https://www.passwordmonster.com and https://passwordmeter.com password strength checkers.

Recorded the score, estimated time to crack, and feedback.

### Result:

#### 1) Weak Passwords (easily cracked in seconds):

123456, abcd, password, admin, KRISHNA, krishna

These are either too short, all lowercase/uppercase, or common dictionary words.

#### 2) Medium Strength (minutes to hours to crack):
   
Flipkart, Krishna123, Krishna2025

These include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters with numbers but lack symbols.

#### 3) Strong Passwords (years to crack):

Krishna@2025, Krish9a@2025, Krish9a@2025!, Asltw@2025!

These include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and are based on random or phrase-based methods.

#### Best Result: Asltw@2025! — derived from the phrase “Actions speak louder than words.” It combines letters, numbers, and symbols, making it the hardest to crack.

### Best Practices Learned:

1) Use at least 12+ characters.

2) Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

3) Avoid common words, names, or predictable patterns.

4) Passphrase-based passwords (using memorable sentences with modifications) are both secure and easy to remember.

5) Regularly update passwords and avoid reusing them across accounts.

### Common Password Attacks

1) Brute Force Attack – systematically trying all possible combinations.

2) Dictionary Attack – using common words and leaked passwords lists.

3) Hybrid Attack – combining dictionary words with numbers/symbols.

### Summary:

The experiment shows that simple passwords can be cracked instantly, while well-structured passwords with complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) can take years to crack. The strongest password generated was:

Asltw@2025! – Secure, memorable (phrase-based), and resistant to brute force attacks.
